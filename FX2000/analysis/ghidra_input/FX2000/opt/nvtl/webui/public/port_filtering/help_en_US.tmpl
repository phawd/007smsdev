<div id="port_filtering">
	<h1>Port Filtering</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>
		Use the Port Filtering feature as needed to block outgoing Internet traffic. If this setting is turned on, only traffic from the selected applications can access the Internet. Traffic is identified by port numbers. 
Some applications are pre-defined. You can define additional applications, but you need to know details of the traffic used and generated by the applications you wish to define. 
	</p>

	<h2>Applications</h2>
	<h3>Application Checkboxes</h3>
	<p>Use these check boxes to allow access to the Internet for each application while the Port Filtering feature is on. Traffic from selected applications can access the Internet. Otherwise, the traffic is blocked. 
	</p>
	<p>The following table provides port numbers and protocol information for each port filtering application listed.</p>

	<p><b>Yes</b> indicates the protocol is standardized for the port number.</p>
	<p><b>No</b> indicates the protocol is standardized for the port number.</p>
	<p><b>Assigned</b>  indicates the port number is assigned by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) for protocol use, but may not be standardized.</p>

	<h2>Custom Applications</h2>
	<p>This feature allows you to define your own applications - up to 10. Once defined, these applications can be turned on and off the same way as pre-defined applications. To define an application, you need to know the ports and protocol (TCP, UDP) used by the application for outgoing traffic. To start, click the <strong>Add Custom Application</strong> button, then provide the following data. 
	</p>
	<p>Note that any changes to a Custom Application are not saved until the "Save Changes" button is used to save the entire page contents.</p>
	
	<h3>Application Checkbox</h3>
	<p>Use this check box to turn on an application after you have defined it. If selected, traffic from this application can access the Internet. Otherwise, the traffic is blocked. 
	</p>
	<h3>Application Name</h3>
	<p>
		Enter a suitable name for the application you are defining.
	</p>
	<h3>Port Range (Start Port/End Port)</h3>
		<p>
			Each application has its own port range.
			Enter the beginning and end of the port range for each application.
		</p>
		<div class="blockgroup">
			<ul>
				<li>For a single port, enter the port number in both the <strong>Start Port</strong> and <strong>End Port</strong> fields.</li>
				<li>For a port range, enter the beginning of the range in the <strong>Start Port</strong> field and the end of the range in the <strong>End Port</strong> field. </li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	<h3>Start Port</h3>
	<p>
		Enter the beginning of the range of port numbers used by outgoing traffic for the custom application being added.
	</p>
	<h3>End Port</h3>
	<p>
		Enter the end of the range of port numbers used by the application.
		<b>NOTE:</b> If the application uses a single port instead of a range, type the same
	</p>
	<h3>Protocol</h3>
	<p>
		Select the protocol used by the port range from the drop-down list (TCP, UDP, or both). 
	</p>
	<h3>Delete</h3>
	<p>Use this checkbox to delete a custom application.
	</p>
	<p>NOTE: Click on the Port Filtering tab again to remove deleted custom applications from view on the screen. </p>
