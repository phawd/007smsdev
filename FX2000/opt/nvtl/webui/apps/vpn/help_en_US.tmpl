	<h2>Overview</h2>
         <p>This feature allows you to configure and enable secure connections to remote networks over a public network using Open VPN. If Open VPN is connected, there is no need for devices connected to the gateway to use their own Open VPN client.
         <b>NOTE: </b>When an Open VPN connection is established, Port Filtering and Port Forwarding settings are not effective, as traffic from all connected devices goes through the Open VPN tunnel. 
         </p>
        
	<h2>Auto-connect VPN</h2>
         
         <p>
                 If ON, the VPN tunnel will automatically be established whenever an Internet connection is made. If OFF, you must establish the VPN connection manually.
