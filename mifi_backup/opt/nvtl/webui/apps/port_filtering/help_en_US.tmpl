<div id="port_filtering">
	<h1>Port Filtering</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>
		Use the Port Filtering feature as needed to block outgoing internet traffic. If this setting is turned on, only traffic from the selected applications can access the internet. Traffic is identified by port numbers. 
Some applications are pre-defined. You can define additional applications, but you need to know details of the traffic used and generated by the applications you wish to define. 
	</p>

	<h2>Applications</h2>
	<p>Use the checkboxes to allow access to the internet for each application while the Port Filtering feature is on. Traffic from selected applications can access the internet. Otherwise, the traffic is blocked. 
	</p>
	<h2>Custom Applications</h2>
	<p>This feature allows you to define your own applications - up to 10. Once defined, these applications can be turned on and off the same way as pre-defined applications. To define an application, you need to know the ports and protocol (TCP, UDP) used by the application for outgoing traffic. To start, click the <strong>Add Custom Application</strong> button, then provide the following data. 
	</p>
	<p>Note that any changes to a Custom Application are not saved until the "Save Changes" button is used to save the entire page contents.</p>
	
	<h3>The On Checkbox</h3>
	<p>Use the On checkbox to turn on an application after you have defined it. If selected, traffic from this application can access the internet. Otherwise, the traffic is blocked. 
	</p>
	<h3>App Name</h3>
	<p>
		Enter a name for the application you are defining.
	</p>
	<h3>Port Range (Start Port/End Port)</h3>
		<p>
			Each application has its own port range.
			Enter the beginning and end of the port range for each application.
		</p>
		<div class="blockgroup">
			<ul>
				<li>For a single port, enter the port number in both the <strong>Start Port</strong> and <strong>End Port</strong> fields.</li>
				<li>For a port range, enter the beginning of the range in the <strong>Start Port</strong> field and the end of the range in the <strong>End Port</strong> field. </li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	<h3>Protocol</h3>
	<p>
		For each port range, select the protocol (TCP or UDP) used by that port range.
