        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>From this page, you can lock and unlock the SIM card and change the SIM PIN.</p>
	<p>Locking the Jetpack’s SIM card prevents the Jetpack and connected devices from connecting to the mobile network.</p>
	<p>After you lock the SIM card, you’ll need to enter the PIN to connect to the mobile network. You’ll also need to enter the PIN if you turn your Jetpack off and on again.</p>
	<h3><tmpl_var truncate(_("webui", "adv_sim_pin_lock_feature_label"), (size(_("webui", "adv_sim_pin_lock_feature_label")) - size(":")))>
	</h3>
		<p>This field indicates whether the SIM PIN Lock is on or off.  When on, the SIM PIN must be entered to connect to the mobile network.</p>

	<h3><tmpl_var truncate(_("webui", "adv_sim_status_label"), (size(_("webui", "adv_sim_status_label")) - size(":")))></h3>
	<p>The field indicates the current status of the SIM card. Possible values are: </p>
	<div class="blockgroup">
	        <ul>
	        <li><b>Ready—</b>The SIM PIN Lock is off </li>
	        <li><b>PIN Locked—</b>The SIM PIN Lock is on and the Jetpack can’t connect to the mobile network. Enter the SIM PIN to give connected devices internet access.</li>

		<p>Note: If the wrong PIN is entered too many times, the SIM card will be PUK locked.</p>
	        <li>PUK Locked—Due to too many failed attempts to unlock this Jetpack's SIM card, a PIN Unblocking Key (PUK) is now required. You can get the PUK from your service provider.</li>

		<p>Note: If the wrong PUK is entered too many times, the SIM card will be permanently locked and will have to be replaced.</p>
		
	        <li><b>Unlocked—</b>The SIM PIN Lock is on and the SIM PIN has been entered successfully.  </li>
	        <li><b>No SIM—</b>No SIM card is detected. Insert a SIM card or make sure the SIM card is installed properly.</li>
	        <li><b>SIM Error—</b>A SIM card is detected but did not respond as expected and can’t be used. </li>       
	        </ul>
	</div>
	<h2>Desired Action</h2>
	<p>Select what you want to do: turn the PIN Lock on or off or change the PIN.</p>
	<p>Note: When changing the PIN on a Verizon Wireless SIM, the new PIN must be 4-8 digits.</p>
	<h2>Current PIN</h2>
	<p>You’ll need to enter the current PIN before you can turn the PIN Lock on or off or change the PIN.</p>
