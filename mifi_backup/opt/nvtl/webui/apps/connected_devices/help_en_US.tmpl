	<h1><tmpl_var _("webui", "connected_devices_menu_text")></h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>This page displays details of each device connected to the <tmpl_var _("webui", "webui_product_name")>, and also lists any blocked devices.
	</p>

	<h2><tmpl_var _("webui", "connected_devices_sub_header_text")></h2>
	<p>This table lists all devices connected to the <tmpl_var _("webui", "webui_product_name")>. Tap the V to see more information about the device.
	</p>
	<p>
		The following information is displayed for each connected device:
	</p>

	<h3>Connection Type</h3>
	<p>An icon indicates the connection type for each connected device.
	</p>

	<h3>Name</h3>
	<p>Normally, this is the hostname of the connected device, as set on the connected device itself.
	    In rare cases, the hostname may be unavailable.
		If you have used the Edit option to change the name of a connected device, the name you provided is displayed in place of the hostname.
	</p>
	<p>You can use the Edit option to change the name of any connected device.
	</p>

	<h3>IP Address</h3>
	<p>
		The IP address of the connected device.
	</p>
	<h3><tmpl_var truncate(_("webui", "connected_devices_mac_address_label"), (size(_("webui", "connected_devices_mac_address_label")) - size(":")))></h3>
	<p>
		The MAC address is a unique network identifier for this connected device.
	</p>

	<tmpl_if isIPv6Supported>
	<h3><tmpl_var truncate(_("webui", "connected_devices_link_local_label"), (size(_("webui", "connected_devices_link_local_label")) - size(":")))>
	</h3>
	<p>If the connected device supports IPv6, the Link-Local IPv6 address is displayed. </p>
	</tmpl_if>
	
	<h2>Blocking and Unblocking Devices</h2>
	<h3>Block Button</h3>
	<p>
	Clicking the Block button disconnects the connected device and prevents it from reconnecting. The blocked device then appears in the Blocked List. 
	</p>
	<p>Blocked devices are blocked from both the guest and primary network.
	</p>
	<p>
	This option is available for use with each connected device, with the exception of your own device, and any device connected via USB.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Blocked List</h3>
	<p>
		This lists any devices you have blocked. Note that since these devices are not currently connected and are blocked from connecting, they do not have an IP address.
		Instead, they are identified by their name and MAC address.

	</p>
	<h3>Unblock Button</h3>
	<p>
		Clicking the Unblock button unblocks a previously blocked device, freeing it to connect again. The unblocked device is deleted from the Blocked List, and will reappear in the Connected Devices list when it connects.
	</p>
